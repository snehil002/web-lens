      <h1>Welcome To Snehil's Little Tech Blog</h1>

      <p>
        This is a dummy website. It is created to demonstrate 
        a Web Analytics Project I created. Hence, it is 
        being tracked for analytics purposes. No personal data
        is recorded. Time spent on page, date of visit, 
        traffic source and width of page are tracked.
        Thanks, Snehil.
      </p>
